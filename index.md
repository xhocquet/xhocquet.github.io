# Welcome to my personal page.

I maintain this as a way to share some information about myself and make myself reachable. I also toss side-projects on here and remove them as I lose interest. This site is built with Hugo and hosted on Github.

Please take a look at some of my writing, such as my [blog](/reflections) or [recipes](/recipes). You can also check out my [code](/code) and [game reviews](/reviews).

While I don't love social media, you can find me around the internet tracking my favorite hobbies. Check out my [github profile](https://github.com/xhocquet), my [record collection](http://www.discogs.com/user/meesles/collection), my [anime list](https://anilist.co/user/meesles/animelist), or my [reading list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/52019754-xavier-hocquet). All are frequently updated.

If you need to reach me, [email](mailto:xhocquet@gmail.com) is my prefered means of communication. I am always open to hearing about exciting new opportunities, my CV can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkF057FcXJHJ0WFpiFlqJ3t80GODgBVdQNpsUFtZEBs/edit?usp=sharing).
