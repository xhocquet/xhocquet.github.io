# Welcome to my personal site.
<br>

I maintain this as a way to share some information about myself and be reachable. I also toss side-projects on here and remove them as I lose interest. This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and hosted on [Github](https://github.com/xhocquet/xhocquet.github.io).

If you're interested in things spewing from my brain, check out the [blog](/reflections) or my [code](/code). I also use this site to store [recipes](/recipes) and share the occasional [game review](/reviews).

I avoid Big Social Media, but you can spot me around the internet tracking my favorite hobbies. Check out my [github profile](https://github.com/xhocquet), my [record collection](http://www.discogs.com/user/meesles/collection), my [anime list](https://anilist.co/user/meesles/animelist), or my [reading list](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/52019754-xavier-hocquet). All are frequently updated (except for my reading list, which is a testament to my reading habits).

If you need to reach me, [email](mailto:xhocquet@gmail.com) is my prefered means of communication. I am always open to hearing about exciting new opportunities, my CV can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NkF057FcXJHJ0WFpiFlqJ3t80GODgBVdQNpsUFtZEBs/edit?usp=sharing). LinkedIn and other links can be found below.
