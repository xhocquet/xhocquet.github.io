      <description>I love tracking things. It feeds my need to always be up-to-date on my progress. I feel that by knowing my status at all times, I can optimize my decisions at any moment to increase my productivity. Some may call that over-optimizing, but I believe it&amp;rsquo;s part of who I am and lets me perform at a high level while maintaining free time.&#xA;This happens on a bunch of levels, for example: In the morning, I&amp;rsquo;m tracking the train moving through the city until it reaches my stop to optimize when I should go to bed and wake up.</description>

      <description>I like to decribe Civilization as the board game Risk but made interesting with software. The difficulty with simulation games is the sheer amount of information the user wants and needs to optimize their gameplay. You can see how something like a flight simulator would be quite complex. Now consider developing a simulator of human history (within a reasonable scope of effort). Crowd mentalities, statecraft, geopolitics. All these academic subjects about which humans know just the basics about must be concretely applied to the game in a tangible and rewarding, all while keeping it all balanced.</description>
