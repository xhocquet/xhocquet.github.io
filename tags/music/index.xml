      <description>This is part 3 of my music organization series. Check out part 1 and part 2 for the full context.&#xA;The Problem with Discovery After setting up beets and getting my library properly organized, I found myself facing a new challenge: actually using my music collection.

      <description>I wanted to try a new series on music to try and spur some writing! My thought was that I hope to discover at least one new great artist a month, and that writing about them should be easy if I really like them! This month, we&amp;rsquo;ll start with hip-hop which should be a common theme through these posts.&#xA;My artist of choice this month is Tobi Lou a Nigeria-to-Chicago rapper whose unique style is endearing and captivating.</description>
