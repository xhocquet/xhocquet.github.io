      <description>I like to decribe Civilization as the board game Risk but made interesting with software. The difficulty with simulation games is the sheer amount of information the user wants and needs to optimize their gameplay. You can see how something like a flight simulator would be quite complex. Now consider developing a simulator of human history (within a reasonable scope of effort). Crowd mentalities, statecraft, geopolitics. All these academic subjects about which humans know just the basics about must be concretely applied to the game in a tangible and rewarding, all while keeping it all balanced.</description>

      <description>xhocquet@::1 ~ $ / games / civilization 6     My Thoughts  Good Mods
Yet (not) Another Maps Pack Known as YnAMP. Detailed new map additions.
 Terra Mirabilis Large rework of natural wonders.
 Detailed Worlds Adds a bit more flavor to continents instead of blobs.
 Production Queue Really solid quality-of-life enhancement. If you have a set production order for new cities, this saves you some time.</description>

      <title>Protecting my Electronic Life: Part 2</title>

      <description>After some common-sense practices to use, I wanted to switch over to privacy and data online and off. Your privacy is literally under attack every day from countless sources, usually trying to pry out as much data from your activity as they can without breaking the law. I used to not care. I felt that since I had nothing to hide, it didn’t bother me that some companies could use my data points to make new things.</description>

      <description>Technology scares me. I consider myself lucky in that I can navigate it and make educated decisions, but at the same time I realize that I rely on hundreds of technologies every day and I don&amp;rsquo;t even know how they work!
The most frightening thing is how fast it’s all happening. I thought I would be up-to-date for much longer than my parents were, or even my peers are today. It turns out another internet-addicted generation is already steadily replacing my idea of normal.</description>

      <description>Check out my code here  Meteor Exploration (and friend, Angular) I decided to look into Meteor because of it&amp;rsquo;s general popularity in enterprise. I was curious what made it attractive versus a typical app with Angular or React backed by some data store.
Meteor offers generous documentation and tutorials, one of which I decided to follow. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t too interested in diving into mobile at this time, so I stuck with their simple to-do app.</description>

      <description>While I started my programming career closer to the hardware with C, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to be comfortable as web dev using Ruby and Javascript as my main languages. Ruby will be my focus in this post, but believe the two languages share more similarities than most realize.
These days, it feels like more and more time passes between each time I write code. Everyone on my career path goes through it, but as you graduate past a junior role you start to offer more and more of your time to others instead of strictly writing code.</description>

      <description>It feels like every day, it gets harder to put a simple website online. Between defending against spam, vulnerabilities in your dependencies, system maintenance, scaling, and a million others, the sheer amount of knowledge needed can be overwhelming. Even though most sites share the same base, you can be sure you&amp;rsquo;ll spend a significant amount of time patching it together again from past experiences and scattered blog posts.
Services like Heroku, Digital Ocean, and AWS attempt to make all of this more accessible by abstracting it all away in a variety of tools.</description>

      <description>Amidst the deluge of super-heroes, magic-fantasy, and monster invasions in anime, one forgets what else there is. That anime is a huge medium spanning languages and genres like anything else. Specifically, I had forgotten one of my favorite genres, which I call (perhaps a little crudely) &amp;lsquo;Asian Hip-Hop&amp;rsquo;.
Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been craving it. Somewhere in the realm of Cowboy Bebop and Afro Samurai lives what I consider the golden genre of anime.</description>

      <title>Belgian Mayo: Seriously</title>

      <description>Mayo and Me Today, I want to give mayonnaise the proper attention it deserves. A recent underdog in the American condiment game, mayo is quickly gaining popularity and climbing the sauce ladder. 1 This comes as a huge relief, since I&amp;rsquo;ve often pondered how long I can survive in a country that treats my favorite sauce as a second class citizen.
As a proud Belgian, it&amp;rsquo;s only natural to speak the gospel of mayonnaise.</description>
