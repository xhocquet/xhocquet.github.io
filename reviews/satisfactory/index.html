<div class="post-content">

  <p>This post/review is dedicated to <a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/">Satisfactory</a>, a first-person
    factory builder which has been a treat to have on hand during the COVID19 quarantine! Inspired by the likes of <a
      href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a>, I knew I was probably going to love it. The creators also made the
    wildly successful <a href="http://goat-simulator.com/">Goat Simulator</a>, giving them a warm start with this new
    project!</p>

  <p>These games are sandbox games, so there's no true end or objective, but in essence you want to build the biggest
    and most efficient factory possible. Satisfactory gives you direction in the game by way of a few different
    achievement systems. These involve providing resources of certain types to complete objectives. As they naturally
    require you to create more and more of your more complex parts, you'll have to build out your factory and organize
    it to make sense of things.</p>

  <p>I think this is a great implementation of a tutorial-like system which points you to what you should be focusing on
    instead of dropping you into a massive simulator. One big gripe I had though is that there is almost an implied
    order to the objectives which can be ignored and cost you later. If you, like me, invest heavily in a later-stage
    objective and then miss out on building out a more fundamental pipeline for a basic resource, catching that up later
    can feel like a real drag. In general, it seems like you should follow the objectives from the first level and move
    on as you complete a level.</p>

  <span class="post-title">3D</span><br><br>

  <p>The 3D implementation of this game is pretty interesting since it provides a couple of new mechanics for players to
    play with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Vertical organization</li>
    <li>Vertical movement</li>
  </ul>

  <p>They're pretty similar, but what I mean by vertical organization is placing the actual objects in three dimensions.
    This lets you stack storage containers, create multiple levels for a factory, or wrap transportation above and below
    existing structures. 2D factory games would trend towards grids and you always needed long corridors kept clear for
    future work, and lots and lots of squares to organize different areas of your factory. In two dimensions your shapes
    are really limited, so the third dimension opens up a new exponential level of possibilities which makes the game
    much more playable over time.</p>

  <p>The second point is about more efficiently navigating your area. In 2D factory builders, by nature of not having a
    third dimension, you cannot go over or below certain objects. That means that your build is directly coupled to your
    ability to navigate your build, which is I consider quite a big limitation. No third dimensions also means you can't
    fly over things and transportation is much more limited. One of my favorite additions to Satisfactory are jump pads
    which launch you across the map. Just being able to skip over large areas makes moving and working on another part
    of your factory makes you feel like you aren't spending large amounts of time just walking places.</p>

  <span class="post-title">Maps/Visuals</span><br><br>

  <img src="/reviews/satisfactory/maps.jpg" style="max-height: 400px; margin: 0 auto;" class="img-responsive"
    alt="Responsive image" />
  <br><br>

  <p>This is a pretty game, there's no doubt about that. The game currently offers four maps to choose from, each with a
    unique color palette and their own challenges. Some of the maps have more or less biological vs. mineral resources,
    so these can keep the game fresh and force you to account for the missing resources in different ways. As you gather
    resources, you'll find yourself clearing out areas of trees and basically terraforming the map to your needs. This
    gives a lot of flexibility in how you build and doesn't force you into a certain metagame. Personally I really
    enjoyed building my factory into the nature without creating tons of floors and walls. It makes the factory less
    'perfect' but more organic, and more enjoyable for me to navigate.</p>

  <p>These maps are huge and dense with activity, not to mention quite interactive. Boulders and map features are
    modeled well-enough to interact with and use for platforming, even to the point of being required to reach some
    places. That being said, on my first playthrough I hardly needed to leave the immediate vicinity since my three
    beginning resources were available in a small radius. This gave me time to get my factory up-and-running before
    needing to venture too far out into the world. I think this is another example of a well thought-out mechanic like
    the objectives that help guide the player to learn and explore the game the first couple of times that they play.
  </p>

  <span class="post-title">Mechanics</span><br><br>

  <p>The factory building is generally similar to what you may have experienced in other games, but I wanted to hone in
    more on the RPG side of things and how I think it was pretty well integrated into the overall feel of the game.</p>

  <p>The first mechanic to call out is the presence of monsters. While not a huge part of the game, you simply can't get
    to certain places early on because you don't have enough health or strong enough weapons. These areas tend to have
    higher-level resources so as you might expect, you eventually need to craft items that allow you to reach these
    places. Besides general combat and giving you a reason to craft things besides what you need for your factory, the
    monsters act as simple way to control the map and prevent you from venturing too far away from your main objective.
  </p>

  <p>Another fun mechanic is the collectible items. Slugs are littered throughout the map and used to craft upgrades,
    and some are in hard-to-reach places that require some creativity. A personal favorite so far was a huge arch that
    spanned over my main base. I actually didn't even realize it was there until the scanner told me to look up for a
    slug. What followed was me trying to reach the slug at the crest of this extremely thin archway and falling to my
    death more than once. The maps are full of little nooks and crannies such as these that can be a good distraction
    from the regular grind of factory building or while you're waiting for resources to be crafted.</p>

  <br><br>

  <p>In closing, I would recommend this game to anyone that's enjoyed a similar style of simulation or factory building
    game before. It executes quite well on the mechanics from previous games and it also adds some fresh mechanics to
    keep you and your teammates entertained over long play sessions. Add a fresh art-style, solid UI, and a smooth feel
    to the entire experience, and this game stands out as a perfect time-waster.</p>
