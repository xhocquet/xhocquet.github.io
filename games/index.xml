      <description>This post/review is dedicated to Satisfactory, a first-person factory builder which has been a treat to have on hand during the COVID19 quarantine! Inspired by the likes of Factorio, I knew I was probably going to love it. The creators also made the wildly successful Goat Simulator, giving them a warm start with this new project!
These games are sandbox games, so there&#39;s no true end or objective, but in essence you want to build the biggest and most efficient factory possible.</description>

      <description>My Thoughts  Good Mods
Yet (not) Another Maps Pack Known as YnAMP. Detailed new map additions.
 Terra Mirabilis Large rework of natural wonders.
 Detailed Worlds Adds a bit more flavor to continents instead of blobs.
 Production Queue Really solid quality-of-life enhancement. If you have a set production order for new cities, this saves you some time.
 Sukritact&#39;s Great Blue Hole Shout-out since I&#39;ve been here in real life.</description>
