<div class="post-content">

  <p>This post/review is dedicated to <a href="https://www.satisfactorygame.com/">Satisfactory</a>, a first-person factory builder which has been a treat to have on hand during the COVID19 quarantine! Inspired by the likes of <a href="https://factorio.com/">Factorio</a>, I knew I was probably going to love it. The creators also made the wildly successful <a href="http://goat-simulator.com/">Goat Simulator</a>, giving them a warm start with this new project!</p>

  <p>These games are sandbox games, so there's no true end or objective, but in essence you want to build the biggest and most efficient factory possible. Satisfactory gives you direction in the game by way of a few different achievement systems. These involve providing resources of certain types to complete objectives. As they naturally require you to create more and more of your more complex parts, you'll have to build out your factory and organize it to make sense of things.</p>

  <p>I think this is a great implementation of a tutorial-like system which points you to what you should be focusing on instead of dropping you into a massive simulator. One big gripe I had though is that there is almost an implied order to the objectives which can be ignored and cost you later. If you, like me, invest heavily in a later-stage objective and then miss out on building out a more fundamental pipeline for a basic resource, catching that up later can feel like a real drag. In general, it seems like you should follow the objectives from the first level and move on as you complete a level.</p>

<span class="post-title">3D</span><br><br>

  <p>The 3D implementation of this game is pretty interesting since it provides a couple of new mechanics for players to play with:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Vertical organization</li>
    <li>Vertical movement</li>
  </ul>

  <p>They're pretty similar, but what I mean by vertical organization is placing the actual objects in three dimensions. This lets you stack storage containers, create multiple levels for a factory, or wrap transportation above and below existing structures. 2D factory games would trend towards grids and you always needed long corridors kept clear for future work, and lots and lots of squares to organize different areas of your factory. In two dimensions your shapes are really limited, so the third dimension opens up a new exponential level of possibilities which makes the game much more playable over time.</p>

  <p>The second point is about more efficiently navigating your area. In 2D factory builders, by nature of not having a third dimension, you cannot go over or below certain objects. That means that your build is directly coupled to your ability to navigate your build, which is I consider quite a big limitation. No third dimensions also means you can't fly over things and transportation is much more limited. One of my favorite additions to Satisfactory are jump pads which launch you across the map. Just being able to skip over large areas makes moving and working on another part of your factory makes you feel like you aren't spending large amounts of time just walking places.</p>

<span class="post-title">Maps/Visuals</span><br><br>

  <img src="./satisfactory maps.jpg" style="max-height: 400px; margin: 0 auto;" class="img-responsive" alt="Responsive image" />
  <br><br>

  <p>This is a pretty game, there's no doubt about that. The game currently offers four maps to choose from, each with a unique color palette and their own challenges. Some of the maps have more or less biological vs. mineral resources, so these can keep the game fresh and force you to account for the missing resources in different ways. As you gather resources, you'll find yourself clearing out areas of trees and basically terraforming the map to your needs. This gives a lot of flexibility in how you build and doesn't force you into a certain metagame. Personally I really enjoyed building my factory into the nature without creating tons of floors and walls. It makes the factory less 'perfect' but more organic, and more enjoyable for me to navigate.</p>

  <p>These maps are huge and dense with activity, not to mention quite interactive. Boulders and map features are modeled well-enough to interact with and use for platforming, even to the point of being required to reach some places. That being said, on my first playthrough I hardly needed to leave the immediate vicinity since my three beginning resources were available in a small radius. This gave me time to get my factory up-and-running before needing to venture too far out into the world. I think this is another example of a well thought-out mechanic like the objectives that help guide the player to learn and explore the game the first couple of times that they play.</p>

<span class="post-title">Mechanics</span><br><br>

  <p>The factory building is generally similar to what you may have experienced in other games, but I wanted to hone in more on the RPG side of things and how I think it was pretty well integrated into the overall feel of the game.</p>

  <p>The first mechanic to call out is the presence of monsters. While not a huge part of the game, you simply can't get to certain places early on because you don't have enough health or strong enough weapons. These areas tend to have higher-level resources so as you might expect, you eventually need to craft items that allow you to reach these places. Besides general combat and giving you a reason to craft things besides what you need for your factory, the monsters act as simple way to control the map and prevent you from venturing too far away from your main objective.</p>

  <p>Another fun mechanic is the collectible items. Slugs are littered throughout the map and used to craft upgrades, and some are in hard-to-reach places that require some creativity. A personal favorite so far was a huge arch that spanned over my main base. I actually didn't even realize it was there until the scanner told me to look up for a slug. What followed was me trying to reach the slug at the crest of this extremely thin archway and falling to my death more than once. The maps are full of little nooks and crannies such as these that can be a good distraction from the regular grind of factory building or while you're waiting for resources to be crafted.</p>

  <br><br>

  <p>In closing, I would recommend this game to anyone that's enjoyed a similar style of simulation or factory building game before. It executes quite well on the mechanics from previous games and it also adds some fresh mechanics to keep you and your teammates entertained over long play sessions. Add a fresh art-style, solid UI, and a smooth feel to the entire experience, and this game stands out as a perfect time-waster.</p>
