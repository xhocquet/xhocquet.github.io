Lately some evenings I've been considering why I code, for fun, on the [boxr gem](https://github.com/cburnette/boxr).

The truth is, it's a hobby like gardening. I can sit down, put on my proverbial gloves, and tend to a simple codebase I know well. I can pick out some weeds like an inconsistent pattern across a few methods, or install a wire fence in the form of CI/CD. Things that are usually laborious and time-consuming at work, I can do at my own pace, the way I want, and without a ton of mental overhead.

A lot of people in software talk about manual hobbies to get their minds off their day jobs. I have some of those too, but at the same time I enjoy coding on the boxr codebase as a way to unwind.

I'm appreciative that I still find joy in my main craft!
