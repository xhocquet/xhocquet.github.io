In classic tech fashion, this blog has been rebuilt with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), pruned, and redeployed!

After setting this site up years ago, I started from essentially a broken state - I had started hacking on the original theme to get some cool effects, like the nested terminal breadcrumbs in the header, and in doing so mixed up static content with the theme's content.

Over the years, I threw random pages on this site (including a Lost Ark tool which garnered 10s of thousands of hits!), continuously disregarding the layout that [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) intended for me to follow.

Then, last week, it all came to a screeching halt when I attempted to upgrade Hugo and get myself out of this mess. The upgrade failed, files were lost, and my manual attempts at piecing things back together ended in frustration after quite a few hours. Rather than continuing doing any hard work, I decided a rewrite was necessary.

Thankfully I don't have too much content on here, so the migration hasn't been too bad. I'm hopeful that with the new setup, I'll be encouraged to post some more.
