This is part 3 of my media organization series. Check out [part 1](../media-tracking) and [part 2](../music-tracking) for the full context.

This post in particular will be focused on my music library.

### Maintaining a Large Music Library

After setting up beets and getting my library properly organized, there's an ongoing task of curating the library and keeping things tidy. As your standards and preferences change, you may also need to identify gaps in your existing library and backfill data/tags. Lyrics and artwork are also part of the deal, as mentioned in the last posts.

After 10s of thousands of tracks, you need tools to help maintain the library.

### Enter Utility Playlists

Utility playlists are playlists used for specific maintenance tasks, such as filling in missing artwork/lyrics, seeing the distribution of your audio qualities/bitrates, etc. Anything you consider important in your library is fair game for these, and below I'll share a screenshot of some of my current utility playlists.

MusicBee once again gets a lot of credit for its ability to create these and have them update so quickly. In the screenshot you'll notice I have a few that I'll mention below -

**Lyrics Playlists**

This doesn't need a lot of explanation, but a couple of gotchas:

1. Depending on your importer setting, you'll need to define a 'this song has no lyrics' marker for tracks, so that your playlist knows what is missing lyrics vs. doesn't actually have any.
2. I keep a '5 Star' version of this playlist as well so I can prioritize tracks I love. There's quite the backlog, especially with Japanese tracks.

**Quality Playlists**

These next couple of playlists are great tools for me to track which parts of my library I'll need to upgrade. For example music I got when I was much younger may be in terrible quality and first on the list to update.

I split tracks a few ways depending on what I'm trying to update:
1. FLAC versions
2. 'Pristine' versions - meaning full, tagged albums
3. 'Non-pristine' which means everything else, usually EDM and Anime tracks which may one day make their way to the clean collection
4. 5-star playlists. Once again to prioritize tracks I want!
