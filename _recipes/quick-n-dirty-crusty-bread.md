### Ingredients

 * <b>3 cups</b> lukewarm water
 * <b>2 lbs.</b> unbleached all-purpose flour
 * <b>1 tablespoon</b> salt
 * <b>1 ½ tablespoons</b> instant or active dry yeast

### Directions

  * Combine all of the ingredients in a large mixing bowl
  * Mix by hand to make a very sticky, rough dough.
  * Cover the bowl, and let the dough rise at room temperature for <b>2 hours</b>.  (optional in case of rush)
  * Refrigerate for <b>2 hours to 7 days</b>. 2 hours will be pretty bland. 7 days will taste like sourdough. 2 days seems to make a good, daily bread.
  * When ready, sprinkle the dough with flour. Grease your hands, and pull off about the size of a softball, or a large grapefruit.
  * Shape the dough on a floured work surface
  * Place the loaf on a parchment-lined baking sheet
  * Sift a light coating of flour over the top; this will help keep the bread moist as it rests before baking.
  * Let the loaf warm to room temperature and rise; this should take about 60 minutes (or longer, up to a couple of hours, if your house is cool). It won't appear to rise upwards that much; rather, it'll seem to settle and expand. Preheat your oven to 450°F while the loaf rests. Place a shallow metal or cast iron pan (not glass, Pyrex, or ceramic) on the lowest oven rack, and have 1 cup of hot water ready to go.
  * When you're ready to bake, take a sharp knife and slash the bread 2 or 3 times, making a cut about 1/2" deep. The bread may deflate a bit; that's OK, it'll pick right up in the hot oven.
  * Place the bread in the oven onto the middle rack and carefully pour the <b>1 cup</b> hot water into the shallow pan on the rack beneath. It'll bubble and steam; close the oven door quickly.
  * Bake the bread for 25 to 35 minutes, until it's a deep, golden brown.
  * Remove the bread from the oven, and cool it on a rack. Store leftover bread in a plastic bag at room temperature.

### Tips

  * Bread flour can be used for a thicker crust and thicker center. Add about <b>2 teaspoons</b> of water per cup of bread flour.
