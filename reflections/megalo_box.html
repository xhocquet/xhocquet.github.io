<p>Amidst the deluge of <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/31964/Boku_no_Hero_Academia">su</a><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/19365/Samurai_Flamenco">pe</a><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/30276/One_Punch_Man">r-h</a><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/9941/Tiger___Bunny">eroes</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34572/Black_Clover">magic-</a><a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/34577/Nanatsu_no_Taizai__Imashime_no_Fukkatsu">fantasy</a>, and <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/24439/Kekkai_Sensen">monster</a> <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/16498/Shingeki_no_Kyojin">invasions</a> in anime, one forgets what else there is. That anime is a huge medium spanning languages and genres like anything else. Specifically, I had forgotten one of my favorite genres, which I call (perhaps a little crudely) ‘Asian Hip-Hop’.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve been craving it. Somewhere in the realm of Cowboy Bebop and Afro Samurai lives what I consider the golden genre of anime. Undeniable classics, they fall into a genre that’s hard to describe: action for certain, but also primarily driven by style and scenes that borrow from pop culture around the world. I call it Asian Hip-Hop as an homage to some of the first works, but the spirit of the genre covers a wide spectrum of cult and mainstream classics. <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/12883/Tsuritama">Tsuritama</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/8795/Panty___Stocking_with_Garterbelt">Panty &amp; Stocking</a>, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/10721/Mawaru_Penguindrum">Mawaru Penguindrum</a>, and even the almighty <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/2001/Tengen_Toppa_Gurren_Lagann">Gurren Lagann</a> belong to or overlap with this genre. Quite a line-up of heavy-hitters, right? The list can go on, but in the end probably less than 10 shows embody and execute primarily on this genre.</p>

<p>Megalo Box has become one of the few modern benchmarks when it comes to Asian Hip-Hop. A focus on delivery and style over action and stimulation, it’s an easy show for any amateur or hardcore fan to dig into. A beautiful world (a city, really) delivered in a consistently satisfying manner. Whether it’s the ragged training gym under the bridge or the fancy stadiums, crisp detail and accented colors almost grab your eyes for attention. Amazingly, little detail is sacrificed for the high-intensity fighting scenes which happen in most episodes. In fact, their continued attention to detail brings fights to life as sparks fly off of their gear. A masterful execution of irregularly timing action sequences (a skill I could write a whole other post on) let’s you actually feel the boxer’s instincts and reactions that the show so heavily glorifies. In this area, I think Megalo Box belongs at the top of the top with the above mentioned.</p>

<p>Prepare to be surprised, but I’m a sucker for sports anime. I love the depth many of them go into, and I really love learning the intricacies of a sport a-la Japanese. Shows like <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/5040/One_Outs">One-Outs</a> and <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/263/Hajime_no_Ippo">Hajime no Ippo</a> are perfect examples, and highly recommended. Megalo Box falls short in this area only because it isn’t trying. In lieu of chibis trying to explain the <a href="https://i.giphy.com/media/Srbrb2K5RE3VS/giphy.webp">Rolling Dempsey</a> to a complete amateur like myself, this show takes more of an <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1292/Afro_Samurai">Afro Samurai</a> approach with big bosses to defeat, short/intense training sequences, and a straightforwad storyline in between to fill it out. This is another great sports anime formula that both shows execute beautifully. However, I found myself reminiscing about Hajime no Ippo and all the beautiful intricacies of boxing. While the cyborg boss and the all-knowing (not?) AI bosses were pretty good, it turns out that grit and perseverance always win.</p>

<p>Which brings me to my last thoughts about the main character. I love characters like Joe. They honestly don’t have a very complicated story. Little romance, a clear objective that is often repeated, and a consistent moral compass. These heroes are predictable, or at the very least your can expect that they’ll do <em>something</em>. A hearty shout-out to my favorite, <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/40/Luffy_Monkey_D">Luffy</a>! There’s plenty of others, but Asian Hip-Hop heroes tend to have one more identifying quality: they’re lone wolves, almost to a fault.</p>

<p>In many of these shows, it feels like the world is against them. Even their allies are so fundamentally different from them that they end up catalyzing the hero in a ‘I can’t handle my first relationship’ kind of way. <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/33/Kenpuu_Denki_Berserk">Berserk</a> comes to mind, and <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/1292/Afro_Samurai">Afro Samurai</a> is another great example. These heroes have so much untapped potential and raw skill, they tend to just solo the whole adventure. Megalo Box was a bit unorthodox in that it seemed like Joe was supposed to be this kind of hero, but there were also moments where his relationship with <a href="https://myanimelist.net/character/160398/Sachio">Sachio</a> drives a lot of momentum. It definitely rounded out his image as a less intense, more laid-back competitor reminiscent of <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/6675/Redline">Redline</a>.</p>

<p>The end didn’t have me feeling complete or satisfied like some of its predecessors. The rosy ends don’t flow well in the universes that these shows create. Often times they are harsh environments from where the hero emerges as an unlikely candidate. For the hero to end up happy-ever-after jarrs from the reality they faced only moments before the end. Megalo Box kind of killed it for me, and not in the good way. My lasting impression of Joe is a half-assed boxer who happened to beat someone who was willing to basically get rid of prostethics to fight him. The lasting respect/forward-facing feeling I’m usually left with were missing, and instead I feel like Joe may or may never box again.</p>

<p>Ending aside, this show had me rewinding scenes and pausing to look at details regularly. It’s clear they gave this the attention it deserved, and now I’m motivated to go check out its 50-year-old ancestor: <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/2402/Ashita_no_Joe">Ashita no Joe</a>!</p>
