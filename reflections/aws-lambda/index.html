                <p>It feels like every day, it gets harder to put a simple website online. Between defending against spam, vulnerabilities in your dependencies, system maintenance, scaling, and a million others, the sheer amount of knowledge needed can be overwhelming. Even though most sites share the same base, you can be sure you&rsquo;ll spend a significant amount of time patching it together again from past experiences and scattered blog posts.</p>
<p>Services like <a href="https://www.heroku.com/">Heroku</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>, and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/">AWS</a> attempt to make all of this more accessible by abstracting it all away in a variety of tools. S3 for storage, EC2 for servers, Elastic IP for networking are some of the examples of what AWS offers to create and manage your infrastructure.</p>
<p>Today, I want to focus on a specific piece of AWS, and how Lambdas can be an ideal solution to your sporadic processing problems!</p>
<h1 id="lambdas">Lambdas?</h1>
<p>In programming, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">lambda</a> (or anonymous function or closure) is a function that isn&rsquo;t tied to a source. A good lambda can be called from anywhere, and give you the same output for the same input.</p>
<p>AWS takes idea, and puts it on the cloud:</p>
<p><img src="/lambda/1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Above, you&rsquo;ll see some of the possible connections it has to other services.</p>
<p>Common uses of Lambdas range from:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a request comes through an API, process the payload and respond to the request.</li>
<li>When an object is uploaded to S3, do something with that object and log the results.</li>
<li>Process the background job queue with my Lambda and send results to my application.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h1 id="why-should-i-use-one">Why should I use one?</h1>
<h2 id="price">Price</h2>
<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s free up to a limit. Their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/">pricing page</a> says you get 400,000 GB-seconds free per month, with a max of 1 million requests. With some creativity, that can serve a small startup extremely well.</p>
<p>After that, the prices are competitive and tiny per operation. The cost benefit tails off for the largest scale, but for a majority of cases it&rsquo;s cheaper than running your own solution.</p>
<h2 id="scaling-help">Scaling help</h2>
<p>Second, you get to leverage AWS&rsquo; massive infrastructure and near-endless resources. If you&rsquo;re reading this, you&rsquo;re probably their target customer. Not only is the compute power cheap, but with it you get a managed scalable system that you don&rsquo;t need to worry about.</p>
<p>If tomorrow you suddenly see a hundred-fold increase in traffic, your Lambdas will run as they always have, spread as wide as needed (and/or configured).</p>
<h2 id="familiar-tools">Familiar tools</h2>
<p>Third, you can leverage a language and package system you already know. Lambdas are written in a set of allowed languages allowing you to use most of your favorite technologies and their ecosystems.</p>
<p><img src="/lambda/2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>For Javascript, you can bundle node modules into your Lambda. For Go, you can include its packages. A Lambda is just a function, but your function can include a plethora of modules (up to a size limit for the Lambda), leaving your options quite open.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="why-shouldnt-i-use-lambdas">Why shouldn&rsquo;t I use Lambdas?</h1>
<h2 id="aws-remains-complex">AWS remains complex</h2>
<p><img src="/lambda/3.png" alt=""></p>
<p>At the end of the day, using even one piece of AWS can be an undertaking. If you or your developers don&rsquo;t use AWS yet, opening it for the first time can be intimidating. There&rsquo;s a minimum of security and access configurations you&rsquo;ll need to run a Lambda, but thankfully there&rsquo;s plenty of guides online to help you out.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-is-key">Asynchronous is key</h2>
<p>Since your function will be running over and over on this Lambda, charged by GB of memory per second, you&rsquo;ll want to aggressively scope what you want it to do before you start development. Lambdas excel at small operations, though you won&rsquo;t save money with operations below 100ms. You are also constrained by AWS with how much code you can upload.</p>
<p>If your Lambda is interacting with outside services like a document store, API, or another server, you&rsquo;ll also want to tightly control the asynchronous flow of those calls. Worst-case scenario, a web request gets stuck and your Lambda times out. Not only did you pay for the most amount of waste allowed under your usage limits, but there wasn&rsquo;t even a result!</p>
<h2 id="ease-of-development">Ease-of-development</h2>
<p>While using your favorite language and its modules is awesome, actually putting code on the Lambda is not so glorious.</p>
<p>Your options are either to use the editor provided in the dashboard:</p>
<p><img src="/lambda/4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This editor is honestly not that bad and has a respectable amount of features. Anyone who has used a web-based code editor knows its challenges, and Amazon hasn&rsquo;t solved them here.</p>
<p>Your other options are to upload the code package either via a manual zip file upload or S3. This will be your preferred method if you plan on including packages. As Lambda uses a special event set-up, you&rsquo;ll find yourself needing to build a testing environment in your local system as well if you&rsquo;re writing anything somewhat complicated. What should have been just writing some code and throwing it on AWS becomes a somewhat involved develop and build process.</p>
<hr>
<h1 id="my-use-cases">My use cases</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve so far implemented two of these for different cases.</p>
<h2 id="document-processing">Document processing</h2>
<p>At Maxwell, we&rsquo;re processing PDFs that can get quite large into images for another system. We ran into challenges isolating this sporadic processing within our infrastructure, resulting in ripple-effects when many large documents came in simultaneously.</p>
<p>Lambdas came to mind as a great solution to isolate the processing from our systems, while also allowing us to tailor memory consumption based on the trends we were seeing. It took about a day for us to build a simple Lambda to hook into our document store, and start processing documents in a variety of ways using popular packages.</p>
<p>As we put it into effect, we expect to be able to reduce some of our larger servers we had boosted because of large document processing. In addition, we didn&rsquo;t spend that much time to get a working proof of concept online. The other great benefit was that we were able to use a language we already know, so the spin-up time was exclusively AWS-related, not code-related.</p>
<h2 id="web-scraping">Web scraping</h2>
<p>For a <a href="http://diyrss.info">personal project</a>, I ping websites regularly to check for new content. The issue is the same: for a flaky operation like scraping a web page, residual effects from poorly managed background queues can leak into your application and cause other issues. This is doubly the case when building a system like this alone, and allows me to off-shore some of the complexities of the task so I can focus on delivery.</p>
<h1 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h1>
<p>All-in-all, Lambdas are a great solution for a variety of problems. More importantly, it&rsquo;s a way of solving a problem that you anticipate will need scaling you aren&rsquo;t yet ready to tackle head-on. While it isn&rsquo;t a replacement for a properly architected system, in today&rsquo;s fast-paced landscape it&rsquo;s one of your best options for putting a scalable function on the web.</p>
