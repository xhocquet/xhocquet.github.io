<p>Today, I want to give mayonnaise the proper attention it deserves. A recent underdog in the American condiment game, mayo is quickly gaining popularity and climbing the sauce ladder. [^1] This comes as a huge relief, since I’ve often pondered how long I can survive in a country that treats my favorite sauce as a second class citizen.</p>

<p>As a proud Belgian, it’s only natural to speak the gospel of mayonnaise. It’s to me what Heinz ketchup is to most folks here: a go-to dipper, topper, and everything-in-betweener for all sorts of foods. My earliest memories take me back to the Christmas markets in Brussels, facing a huge glob of mayo on my cone of fries, trying to decide where to start. (One effective strategy is to abandon the fries at the top, the mayo has them now. Dredge up the piping-hot, crispy specimen below the surface to dip and enjoy.)</p>

<p>I immediately found my faith tested when we moved to the U.S. over 20 years ago. The cultural differences were expectedly great, and differences around food were the first for my young mind to grasp. Fries are an American staple, but I could not find comfort in the international similarities. I simultaneously stared in horror at the obedient rows of ketchup dispensers (refilled many times a day, I’m sure) while searching for my familiar friend along the counter. More often that not, I had to find solace in the sad pile of months-old ‘mayo’, made such that it would not expire after thousands of uninsterested eaters had already come and gone.</p>

<p>I was fortunate enough to regularly go back to Belgium to see my family. As huge food enthusiasts, my parents made it a top priority to stock up on the white gold for however long we would be away. It was rationed like any scarce resource must be, and we looked forward to it as a special treat when mom fried up some fries or croquettes. Naturally, it was not to be wasted on everyday sandwiches! I also distinctly remember a time when the precious cargo was crushed in transit, leaving us to deal with a suitcase full of a months worth of clothes, covered in my favorite topping and its container.</p>

<h2 id="the-right-sauce-at-the-right-time">The Right Sauce at the Right Time</h2>
<p>Compared to ancient mustard and more classical ketchup, mayonnaise is a relative newcomer in the sauce arena. [^2] [^3] [^4] Although a little contested, mayo seems to have originated in the 18th century in France or Spain. It then quickly spread, becoming a staple across the world. Along with Belgium and the U.S., countries like Russia and Japan are also facing a mayonnaise-craze. Though Japanese mayo has its own particularities, at the core all mayo is the same: an emulsion (a forced mixture of unmixable liquids) of eggs, oil, and other ingredients. [^4]</p>

<p>Our emulsified hero fills a much needed gap between its spicier or more heavy-hitting relatives. While ketchup is a great choice for heavier, fried foods, it also has a huge amount of flavor that tends to overshadow everything it touches. This is exactly why young kinds love ketchup on everything, especially the foods they don’t usually like. Mayo hits the sweet-spot between flavorful and light, leaving plenty of room for the food to shine with its own flavors. A good mayo is like a good pickle, a refreshing anchor to keep your mouth light and ready for the next bite.</p>

<p>Mustard is a whole different beast, and a respectable ally to mayonnaise. In fact, many add a bit of mustard to their mayo to help keep everything together. Where mustard raises and accentuates flavors and creates bold new combinations, mayonnaise lives happily in the world of modest support, prefering instead to defer the primary flavor to the other foods on the plate.</p>
